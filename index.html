<a id="inspiration" class="anchor" href="#inspiration" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Inspiration</h2>

<p>Smart bulbs are too expensive for what they are. We figured that we could make a web-app, smart LED that can take advantage of the endless features of your Amazon echo.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-it-does" class="anchor" href="#what-it-does" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it does</h2>

<p>Using Amazon AWS, certain commands are triggered with the voice, such as color change, whose values will then be sent to the nodejs webserver and finally through a monodirectional pipe to the python scripts that directly control the LED.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-we-built-it" class="anchor" href="#how-we-built-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How we built it</h2>

<p>To program Einstein most efficiently, we divided and conquered the work - front end, backend python, backend javascript, Alexa.</p>

<p>In the end, we feel that this was the best way to manage our time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="challenges-we-ran-into" class="anchor" href="#challenges-we-ran-into" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges we ran into</h2>

<p>We had trouble trying to setup threading that would allow Einstein to keep the LEDs flashing at their current PWM, but check for new arguments through the pipe.</p>

<h2>
<a id="accomplishments-that-were-proud-of" class="anchor" href="#accomplishments-that-were-proud-of" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>

<p>We were able to a program that can send commands from an Amazon Alexa, using our voices, to change the color of an LED.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-we-learned" class="anchor" href="#what-we-learned" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What we learned</h2>

<p>The challenges taught us a lot about what you should and should not use when you're crunched for time- avoid using anything but javascript and python. Biggest of all: DON'T USE PIP</p>

<h2>
<a id="whats-next-for-einstein" class="anchor" href="#whats-next-for-einstein" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's next for Einstein</h2>

<p>We would like to be able to use the GPIOs to feed the base of a transistor that allows current to flow from any electronic device to ground, essentially making any electronic device "smart."</p>
